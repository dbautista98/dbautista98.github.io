												<h3>Berkeley SETI Research Center: <br />  &emsp; Breakthrough Listen</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I have been doing research with the Breakthrough Listen group since the fall of 2020. During this time, I have worked on a couple different projects. One of which was an addition to their signal detection algorithm, <a href="https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti">turboSETI</a>, which adds the ability to visualize all the signals detected by the algorithm, in addition to any signals that pass the search criteria. This give us the ability to qualitatively assess the algorithm's performance and judge whether the signal warrants further investigation. An example of the plot it generates can be seen to the left: the red line is how the algorithm predicts the signal to drift in time, and the black lines show the signals that the algorithm flagged. The code I wrote has been added to the turboSETI codebase and can be found <a href="https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti/blob/master/turbo_seti/find_event/plot_dat.py">here</a>.<br/>
											I am currently working on analyzing the long-term statistics of data collected from Green Bank Telescope, in effort to develop an additional quality metric with which we can assess the data. </p>

												<h3>Undergraduate Lab at Berkeley: <br />  &emsp; 21cm Cosmology</h3>
											</header>
												<p>In my first year at UC Berkeley, I had the opportunity to be a part of the <a href="https://ulab.berkeley.edu/labs/physics">Undergraduate Laboratory at Berkeley</a> (ULAB) research program. In this program, my group's research was focused on computational astrophysics, simulating the antenna response of a radio interferometer array under defferent beam models. To do this, we used data from the GLEAM catalog to predict how the antenna would respond to data from the whole sky. Our beam models accounted for the source's position in the sky realtive to the pointing direction of the antenna, as well as the phase difference the light would have between two antenna receivers. This was my first astrophysics project and it gave me a lot of tools that I took with me into my future research projects. During the course of the projet, I became familiar with using several Python packages, including NumPy, AstroPy, and Pandas, in addition to learning how to use GitHub. </p>

												<h3>Georgia Institute of Technology: <br/>  &emsp; Human Heart Segmentation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Over the summer of 2021, I participated in Georgia Institute of Technology's <a href="https://sure.gatech.edu/">Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering/Sciences</a> (SURE) program. I worked in Dr. Wei Sun's Tissue Mechanics Lab, contributing to a project to use deep learning to automate the segmentation of the whole human heart. This is currently an unsolved problem in the field of biomedical engineering, due to the complexity and complex topology of the human heart. My role in contributing to the project was assisting with the labelling of the train-test dataset which will then be used to train the neural net to segment the whole heart.</p>
